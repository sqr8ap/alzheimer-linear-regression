This repository contains all workflow materials developed for our STAT 6021 Final Project, in which we predicted MMSE scores with multiple linear regression and Alzheimer's diagnosis with logistic regression. 

See 'Final_Deliverable' for our presentation containing all model results as well as possible directions for future work.
